# Hospital Management System (Java + JDBC)

Welcome to our Java project tutorial for beginners!  
This repository contains a simple **Hospital Management System** built with **Java** and **JDBC** (MySQL used in examples). The project is designed as a learning resource — you'll get hands-on experience with database design, JDBC connectivity, basic CRUD operations, and simple console-based UI logic.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Set up a Java development environment for database-driven apps  
- Design a relational database schema for hospital management  
- Connect Java to a database using JDBC  
- Implement management of **Patients**, **Doctors**, and **Appointments**  
- Add features like booking appointments and checking doctor availability

---

## 📦 Features
- Create / Read / Update / Delete (CRUD) operations for:
  - Patients
  - Doctors
  - Appointments
- Schedule appointments (with basic conflict checking)
- Check doctor availability for a given date/time
- Simple console-based menu for interacting with the system
- Sample SQL scripts to create schema and seed data

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java (JDK 8+ recommended)
- JDBC (java.sql)
- MySQL (or any RDBMS; update JDBC driver & connection string accordingly)
- Maven or plain `javac`/`java` - your choice

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- Java JDK installed (version 8 or later)
- MySQL server (or another RDBMS)
- MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver) added to your project's classpath
- (Optional) Maven to manage dependencies
